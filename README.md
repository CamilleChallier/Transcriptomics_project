# Transcriptomics_project
In this exercise we are working with a transcriptomics dataset containing 80 samples. 40 samples are biological replicates of human preadipocytes, and the 40 others are differentiated adipocytes. We aim at visualizing these two conditions and identify the key genes that are markers of adipocytes.
